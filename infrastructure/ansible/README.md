# Ansible (K3s & Registry)

Provisioning playbooks to configure K3s cluster on Multipass VMs and set up a local registry.

## Usage
Inventory is generated by `scripts/setup.sh` into `inventory.ini`.
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini configure-k3s.yml setup-registry.yml -v
```

## Notes
- Expects SSH access for user `ubuntu` and public key installed
- Kubeconfig lives on the master at `/home/ubuntu/.kube/config`
- `scripts/setup.sh` handles SSH key distribution and mounting the repo
